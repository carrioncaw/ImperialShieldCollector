# EDMC Imperial Shield Collector Plugin

Simple, no configuration needed. Displays current count of Imperial Shields and the count needed to be able to trade down and max out all tradable manufactured engineering materials. Likely to over-estimate, since it rounds up for any partial trades. Built off of https://github.com/alterNERDtive/EDMC-FuelStatus

## Installation

  * On EDMC's Plugins settings tab press the “Open” button. This reveals the `plugins` folder where EDMC looks for plugins.
  * Download the [latest release](https://github.com/poisonbl/ImperialShieldCollector/releases/latest) of this plugin.
  * Open the `.zip` archive that you downloaded and move the `ImperialShieldCollector` folder contained inside into the `plugins` folder.

  _You will need to re-start EDMC for it to notice the new plugin._
